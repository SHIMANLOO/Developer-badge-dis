After you have created a bot on the official Discord page,
save the above Python file to your PC and paste your bot token in the specified field.

Now open your terminal (cmd) in the folder where the file is located and type the following command
to bring your bot online and complete the installation and configuration process.
      Command to be given at the terminal location : (python bot.py)
      
 If all steps are correct, you should see this message:
                                                            ‚úÖ Bot is ready. Logged in as MyBot#1234
                                                            üîÅ Synced 1 command(s)
                                                            
After activating the bot, ping it to get a response. After the bot responds, you can get your badge.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important: Due to bot verification in Discord, you may not be able to receive the badge for 24-48 hours.
After this time, you will be able to receive the badge

To receive the badge, you must return to the Discord developers page
after the desired time and register your bot there to receive the badge.

The bot will remain online as long as you keep cmd open and will be deactivated when you close the terminal,
but there is no need to worry because your badge will remain afterwards.

To keep your badge, your bot must receive and respond to a command every 30 days.
After each case, there will be no problems for up to 30 days.
However, if it does not receive a command for 30 days, your badge will be deactivated.
Note: You can keep the bot on the host to always be online.

But don't worry. If it is deactivated, you can reactivate it and the badge will return to your profile.
It is better to give the robot a command every 15 or 20 days so that your badge remains on your profile.
If you forget even one percent and 30 days pass and your badge disappears from your profile,
it is not a problem because you can reactivate your badge by giving the robot a command and going to
the Discord Developer Portal page and adding it to your profile.
Enjoy it now...
